# Sign-Language-CNN

Sign Language ClassiÔ¨Åcation using Convolutional Neural Networks.

We aimed to visualize and classify the images in the Sign Language MNIST dataset. The dataset contains images wherein each instance represents a single 28x28 pixel image with grayscale values between 0-255. Our overall strategy was that of simple supervised learning using stochastic mini-batch gradient descent. Our goal was to classify each letter in the dataset, using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
